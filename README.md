## A Quick Overview
Navigating the vast landscape of streaming services challenges users seeking similar movies after watching one, especially when relying solely on genre for recommendations, which may overlook nuanced features.

Our study aims to explore the effectiveness of an **Information Retrieval System for movies**, where we use all available features of a movie **to query similar recommended movies**.

This study aims to answer the question of similar movie recommenders with Information Retrieval system: **if we have an idea of what kind of movie someone likes, what are the best other movies in our catalog that we can offer to them?**
