## A Quick Overview
Navigating the vast landscape of streaming services challenges users seeking similar movies after watching one, especially when relying solely on genre for recommendations, which may overlook nuanced features.

Our study aims to explore the effectiveness of an **Information Retrieval (IR) System for movies**, where we use all available features of a movie **to query similar recommended movies**.

This study aims to answer the question of similar movie recommenders with an Information Retrieval system: **If we have an idea of what kind of movie someone likes, what are the best other movies in our catalog that we can offer to them?**

## Highlights
1. Optimal precision and recall balance was achieved with Default Cosine at k=5.
2. Vectorizer adjustments suit large datasets but often decrease accuracy for smaller datasets.
3. Optimal precision-recall trade-off at k≈5, recall≈0.5 suits small-scale movie recommendation systems.
4. Using Cosine Distance to measure IR Sytems excels for movie systems with textual and similar data.
5. Extending the dataset enhances accuracy, ensuring representative features and data points for movies.
